                <h1>Preparation</h1>
                <p>
                  Many medical illustrators become certified through a graduate
                  master's program, so to start preparing, students should take
                  a mix of natural sciences and arts courses in high school and
                  their undergraduate studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each program has its unique requirements and focuses, but
                  students will need a strong foundation in general, biological
                  and medical science, as well as experience in a wide range of
                  art methods. Writing, research, and ancillary computer skills
                  are also necessary.

                <p>
                  Most medical illustrators pursue Master's degrees from an
                  accredited graduate program, of which there are three in the
                  US and one in Canada. Entrance is competitive and students
                  spend two years taking a mix of medical courses and arts
                  courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some illustrators choose to specialize on certain types of
                  media or specific sciences. Some also choose to become board
                  certified.

                  The career of medical illustration is one of continual growth.
                  Medical illustrators must keep up with medical research and
                  scientific advancements in order to produce accurate work, and
                  they must also keep up with emerging media trends as digital
                  technology advances. Whether by pursuing formal continuing
                  education or by learning individually, medical illustrators
                  continually work to be able to use the latest research and
                  advances.

                  Although medical illustration is an essential field within
                  biocommunications, it is still a fairly small profession, even
                  on a global scale. The highly specialized nature of the work
                  and high demand for creative services means the profession has
                  a good employment outlook, even with so few professionals.
